-The video will be around be 10 minutes long
-The video must depict the process of learning by the AI agent.
-The video must include the learning process in three different environments:
	a) A gap for the agent to learn jumping.
	b)Floating platforms, in order for the agent to learn precise jumping.
	c) a room, divided by a small wall placed in the middle, which will train two AI Agents:

-The coding environment, dependencies, and work setup should be ready by 1.10.2024
-The video should depict the learning process for each  learning environment: one section for the beginning, one section for the mid-way, and last section for the most optimal result reached by the AI agent.
-The video should begin with an explanation of how a Reinforcement Learning agent works.
-The presentation will include: 
a)The final product (the video) 
b)The 3 environments, prepared to be run, in order for the recipients to witness the learning process themselves.
c)The Git repo with all the code used to create the AI models, in order to show to people, who are interested in the technical aspect of the project.
