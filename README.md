# Process_Journal_AI

I have built this prototype in order to begin the learning process of this project, it was supposed to help me to understand how does a machine learning agent work, and how do neural networks function.
I was supposed to begin to understand what the process of creating this personal project will be about and what challanges will i have to face. I also wantd to understand the structure of the scripts,
see what components will I need, if i need any additional libraries or dependencies. In short, i wanted to set-up a very simple agents, in order to figure everything out in the runtime.
As i am in favor of project based learning, i have picked this method of learning becuase it proves efficient, engaing, and simply is my personal choice as the method that brings the most results.
So in summary: This prototype was built by me in order to help me to gain the fundamental understanding of machine learning agents.
